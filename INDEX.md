## Governance Interpretation Hierarchy

In case of ambiguity or conflict, interpretation follows this order:

1. DGCP™ Core Governance (constitutional layer)
2. LICENSE.md (DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025)
3. Governance documents within this repository
4. Reports, summaries, and explanatory materials
5. Narrative or external commentary

Cryptographically verifiable records take precedence over human-readable summaries.

---

## Change Management

This index is maintained as an **append-only reference document**.

Updates to this file occur only when:
- New governance sections are introduced
- Structural changes are formally approved
- Navigation clarity requires enhancement

---

## Closing Note

This index reflects the living nature of DGCP™ governance while preserving clear separation from the DGCP™ constitutional governance baseline established in 2025.
