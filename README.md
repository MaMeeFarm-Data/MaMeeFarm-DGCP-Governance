# MaMeeFarm™ DGCP Governance  
## Living Governance Repository

**Framework:** DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
**Maintained by:** MaMeeFarm™  
**Status:** Active / Living Governance  
**Scope:** Operational and Time-Bound Governance

---

## Purpose

This repository contains the **official living governance layer** of the MaMeeFarm™ DGCP™ framework.

It documents governance that is:
- Operational in nature
- Time-bound and year-specific
- Subject to evolution through documented decisions
- Publicly auditable and append-only

This repository enables DGCP™ governance to operate in real-world conditions without altering its core constitutional principles.

## Relationship to DGCP Core Governance

This repository **does not redefine** DGCP™ core governance.

All governance documents herein operate **under and in reference to** the DGCP™ Core Governance defined in the following repository:

👉 **MaMeeFarm™ DGCP Core Governance**  
https://github.com/MaMeeFarm-Data/MaMeeFarm-DGCP

That repository represents the **constitutional, timeless, and foundational governance layer** of DGCP™.

- Year-specific governance policies (e.g. governance-2026)
