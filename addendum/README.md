# DGCP Governance — Addendums & Controlled Exceptions

**Framework:** DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
**Organization:** MaMeeFarm™  
**Status:** Active / Controlled Addendum Layer  
**Applicability:** Cross-Year, Case-Specific

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **addendums, controlled exceptions, and supplementary governance instruments** issued under the DGCP™ framework.

Addendums exist to address:
- Exceptional operational scenarios
- Clarifications without altering core governance
- Temporary or narrowly scoped governance adjustments

This layer enables flexibility **without compromising constitutional integrity**.

---

## Relationship to Other Governance Layers

Addendums:
- **Do not redefine** DGCP™ Core Governance
- **Do not override** year-specific policies unless explicitly stated
- **Must reference** applicable governance year(s) and decision records

Authority hierarchy remains:
1. DGCP™ Core Governance (constitutional)
2. LICENSE (DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025)
3. Year-specific Governance (e.g., Governance 2026)
4. Addendums and Controlled Exceptions
5. Reports and explanatory materials

---

## Addendum Principles

All addendums must adhere to the following principles:

- **Narrow scope** — limited to defined use cases
- **Explicit duration** — time-bound or condition-bound
- **Non-destructive** — no retroactive alteration of records
- **Documented authority** — issued via formal decision
- **Audit-ready** — suitable for institutional review

---

## Addendum Structure

Each addendum document must include:

- **Addendum ID**
- **Issuance Date**
- **Status:** Active / Expired / Superseded
- **Applicable Governance Year(s)**
- **Scope and Applicability**
- **Addendum Statement**
- **Rationale**
- **Reference Documents**
- **Review or Expiry Conditions**

---

## Examples of Appropriate Addendums

Addendums may address, for example:
- Temporary AI access exceptions under strict license
- Emergency operational adjustments
- Jurisdiction-specific compliance notes
- Transitional governance clarifications

Addendums must never be used to:
- Circumvent core governance
- Create permanent policy via exception
- Obscure accountability or audit trails

---

## Change Management

- All addendums are recorded via public commits
- Issuance must be logged in the relevant `DECISIONS.md`
- Temporal changes must be reflected in the applicable `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Closing Note

This directory exists to preserve DGCP™ governance rigor while acknowledging real-world complexity.

Flexibility is governed, not improvised.
