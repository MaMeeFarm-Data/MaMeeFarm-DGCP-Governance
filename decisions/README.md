# DGCP Governance — Decision Framework & Registry

**Framework:** DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
**Organization:** MaMeeFarm™  
**Status:** Active / Cross-Year Decision Layer  
**Applicability:** All Governance Years

---

## Purpose

This directory defines the **authoritative decision framework and registry** for DGCP™ governance across all operational years.

It establishes how governance decisions are:
- Issued
- Documented
- Interpreted
- Tracked across time

This layer ensures that DGCP™ governance remains **decidable, accountable, and auditable** without ambiguity.

---

## Relationship to Other Governance Layers

The decision layer operates within the following authority hierarchy:

1. DGCP™ Core Governance (constitutional layer)
2. LICENSE (DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025)
3. Year-specific Governance (e.g. Governance 2026)
4. **Decision Framework and Registries**
5. Addendums and Reports

Decisions interpret and operationalize governance; they do not redefine constitutional principles.

---

## Decision Scope

Decisions may address:

- Governance structure and repository management
- Policy interpretation and enforcement
- Approval or denial of exceptions
- Temporal application of governance rules
- Clarifications required by real-world operation

Decisions must never:
- Override DGCP™ core governance
- Retroactively alter historical records
- Create permanent rules via ad-hoc determination

---

## Decision Authority

Governance decisions are issued by authorized human governance actors operating under MaMeeFarm™ authority.

Automation may support documentation but **cannot replace human accountability**.

---

## Decision Registry Structure

Each governance year maintains its own decision registry under:

/governance-YYYY/DECISIONS.md

This directory serves as:
- The **meta-framework** for all decision registries
- The canonical reference for decision structure and interpretation

---

## Standard Decision Entry Format

All decision entries must include:

- **Decision ID** (globally unique)
- **Date** (ISO 8601)
- **Status** (Active / Superseded / Archived)
- **Governance Year**
- **Scope**
- **References**
- **Decision Summary**
- **Rationale**
- **Notes** (optional)

This structure ensures consistency and machine-readability.

---

## Decision Identification

Decision IDs follow this pattern:

DEC-YYYY-XXX

Where:
- `YYYY` = Governance year
- `XXX` = Sequential identifier

---

## Interpretation Rules

In case of conflict or ambiguity:

- Year-specific decision registries provide operational authority
- The CHANGELOG provides temporal sequencing
- DGCP™ core governance retains constitutional priority
- Cryptographically verifiable records prevail over narrative summaries

---

## Change Management

This document is maintained as an **append-only reference**.

Updates occur only when:
- Decision framework evolves
- New governance years are introduced
- Structural clarification is required

---

## Closing Statement

The decision framework ensures that DGCP™ governance is not theoretical.

Every rule can be decided.  
Every decision can be audited.  
Every outcome remains accountable.
