### DEC-2026-002 — Governance Restart and Operational Continuity Confirmation

- **Date:** 2026-01-12  
- **Status:** Active  
- **Scope:** Governance operations and continuity  
- **Reference:**  
  - `INDEX.md`  
  - `reports/TEMPLATE-GOVERNANCE-REPORT.md`  
  - `addendum/TEMPLATE-ADDENDUM.md`  
  - `governance-2026/CHANGELOG.md`

**Decision Summary:**  
Formal confirmation of governance continuity following a short operational pause, and validation that DGCP™ governance remains active, intact, and auditable without retroactive modification.

**Rationale:**  
A brief pause in governance writing does not constitute governance inactivity or lapse. DGCP™ governance is designed to be resilient, append-only, and capable of resuming operations without loss of authority or integrity. This decision affirms continuity and confirms readiness to proceed with structured governance activities.

**Notes:**  
- No changes to DGCP™ Core Governance  
- No retroactive edits to governance records  
- Subsequent governance activities proceed under established 2026 structures
