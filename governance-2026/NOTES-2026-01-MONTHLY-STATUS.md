## Purpose

This note records the observed governance status for the month ending 2026-01-31.

It exists to document monthly governance review outcomes and system stability
**without introducing new governance rules, policies, or decisions**.

---

## Observed Monthly Status

During January 2026:

- DGCP™ governance structures operated consistently and as designed
- No governance incidents or escalations were identified
- No disputes, exceptions, or conflicts were recorded
- Existing policies and decisions remained sufficient
- No additional governance instruments were required

Weekly governance review conducted earlier in the month remains valid
and representative of the overall monthly governance state.

---

## Interpretation

The absence of governance actions throughout the month is considered
a valid and meaningful governance outcome.

Monthly stability indicates:
- Adequate governance design and scope
- Proportional application of governance authority
- Alignment between governance framework and real-world operation

---

## Relationship to Governance Instruments

This note:
- Does not constitute a decision
- Does not introduce or modify policy
- Does not alter governance authority
- Does not supersede weekly or annual governance records

Authoritative governance remains defined by:
- DGCP™ Core Governance
- DGCP™ Governance 2026 documents
- Decision registries and changelogs

---

## Closing Note

Governance effectiveness is reflected not by frequency of change,
but by sustained stability when no action is required.

This monthly record preserves that context.
