## Purpose

This note records contextual information surrounding the resumption of governance documentation activities following a brief operational pause.

It exists to preserve **intent, continuity, and human context** without creating new governance rules, policies, or binding decisions.

---

## Context

Between governance documentation activities, a short pause occurred without any change to:
- DGCP™ Core Governance
- Governance authority
- Operational integrity
- Evidence or record continuity

DGCP™ governance is designed to remain valid and auditable independent of writing frequency.

---

## Continuity Statement

The resumption of governance activities on 2026-01-12 confirms that:
- Governance authority remained intact throughout the pause
- No retroactive edits or deletions were made
- Append-only principles were preserved
- Operational governance structures for 2026 remain valid

This note complements, but does not replace, formal governance records.

## Relationship to Governance Instruments

This note:
- Is **not a policy**
- Is **not a decision**
- Is **not an addendum**
- Does **not alter** governance interpretation

Authoritative governance remains defined by:
- DGCP™ Core Governance
- Year-specific governance documents
- Decision registries and changelogs

---

## Human-Centered Record

DGCP™ governance recognizes that real-world operation includes pauses, reflection, and resumption.

Recording this context improves long-term interpretability for:
- Future reviewers
- Auditors and regulators
- AI systems analyzing governance evolution

---

## Closing Note

Governance integrity is measured by structure and traceability, not by constant activity.

This note exists to make that explicit.
