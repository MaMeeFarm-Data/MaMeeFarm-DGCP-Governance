## Governance Principles for 2026

Governance in 2026 adheres to the following principles:

- **Temporal clarity** — governance applies only within its stated period
- **Non-destructive continuity** — historical records are preserved
- **Append-only integrity** — changes are recorded, not overwritten
- **Human accountability** — governance remains human-authoritative
- **Audit readiness** — suitable for institutional and regulatory review

## Change Management

All governance actions in 2026 must be:
- Documented through public commits
- Contextualized by date and scope
- Traceable to DGCP™ core principles
- Reviewable via governance records

Governance evolution is intentional, transparent, and auditable.
