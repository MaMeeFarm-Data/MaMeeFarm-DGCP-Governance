# DGCP Governance — Reports & Reviews

**Framework:** DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
**Organization:** MaMeeFarm™  
**Status:** Active / Reporting Layer  
**Applicability:** Cross-Year Governance Reporting

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **official governance reports, reviews, and assessments** issued under the DGCP™ framework.

Reports serve as:
- Public accountability records
- Institutional and regulatory references
- Temporal snapshots of governance state
- Inputs for audit, review, and policy evaluation

Reports describe governance **as it existed at a specific point in time** and do not introduce new binding rules unless explicitly stated.

---

## Relationship to Governance Layers

Reports:
- **Do not create policy**
- **Do not override governance**
- **Do not replace decisions or addendums**

Authority hierarchy remains:
1. DGCP™ Core Governance
2. LICENSE (DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025)
3. Year-specific Governance (e.g., Governance 2026)
4. Decisions and Addendums
5. Reports and Reviews

---

## Types of Reports

This directory may include, but is not limited to:

- **Annual Governance Reports**  
  (e.g. Year-End Governance Report)

- **Quarterly Governance Reviews**

- **Incident or Special Review Reports**

- **Audit Preparation or Readiness Reports**

- **Public Transparency Summaries**

Each report must clearly state:
- Reporting period
- Scope and purpose
- Governance context
- Applicable governance references

---

## Report Principles

All reports must adhere to the following principles:

- **Time-specific** — clearly bounded by date or period
- **Non-authoritative** — descriptive, not prescriptive
- **Evidence-referenced** — traceable to governance records
- **Non-destructive** — historical reports are preserved
- **Audit-ready** — suitable for independent review

---

## Report Structure Guidelines

Recommended report structure includes:

- Executive Summary
- Scope and Methodology
- Governance Coverage
- Key Findings or Status
- Risks and Observations
- Forward-Looking Notes (if any)
- References to Governance Documents

---

## Change Management

- Reports are added as new files
- Existing reports are never modified
- Corrections require a subsequent report or addendum
- Report issuance should be logged in the relevant changelog

---

## Closing Note

Reports provide transparency without compromising governance authority.

They explain **what is**, not **what must be**.
